## Taha A

Hello, I am @24Taha42! I am a high school student who loves programming and design challenges. I've done many projects both in and outside of school exploring various languages and uses of programming. I really enjoy game design and simulating real world processes. Also, I'll never turn down a creative demonstration of math principles.
